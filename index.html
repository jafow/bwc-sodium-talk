# Build With Code: Cryptographically Secure Applications 

---

## What is our objective?
To learn ways we can build cryptographically secure programs with JavaScript!

---
## Why do we want to learn about cryptographically secure programs?

Because cryptography is tool that allows us to build applications with certain assurances:
*   that data we _receive_ is *from* who we think it's from
*   that data we _send_ can only be read by the person we intend



...and these assurances give us more control over our own data.

### Scenario:
### Alice wants to send a message to Bob

--
She doesn't care if he knows it came from her. (it's anonymous)

They each have a secret key.
They don't share this with anyone.

They each have a public key, too. They give this away to anyone!

### Scenario:
### Bob receives a message
--

He doesn't know who it came from.

Bob decrypts with his __public__ & __private key__

## Questions:
*   What do I need from you if I want to send you an encrypted message?

--

*   What would happen if a bad person impersonated me, copied my public key, 
and got someone to send them an encrypted message that was meant for me?

# Buffers in Node.js

name: buffers
## Buffers

---
template: buffers
* a Buffer is the interface we use to __read from__ and __change__ chunks of binary
  data.

--
template: buffers
* It corresponds to a block of memory

To get hold of a buffer in Node.js you need to allocate some amount of space
